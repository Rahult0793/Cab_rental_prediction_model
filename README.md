# Cab_rental_prediction_model
We have been given data for a cab rental start-up company. Based on the pilot project we wish to launch this cab services facility. The historical data provided from the pilot project contains data regarding the pickup and drop locations (in co-ordinates), pickup time and passenger count. We now need to apply analytics to predict fare amount i.e we need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city based on these variables. Therefore fare_amount is the dependent variable whereas other variables are independent variables for this project.
